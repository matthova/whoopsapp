### WhoopsApp
You shouldn't have to tell people when you're about to do something stupid, but you probably should. If you're about to do something dangerous:
1. Write a description
2. Pick contacts to be notified
3. Set a timer

If you don't clear the timer the app will call for help.

“Never play to the gallery […] if you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth and when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.” <br />

– David Bowie
